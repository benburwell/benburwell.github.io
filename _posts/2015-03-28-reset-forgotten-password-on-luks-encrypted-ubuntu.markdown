description: I recently needed to reset a lost password on an Ubuntu installation. But the LUKS encryption on the disk gave me some challenges. Here's what I did.

Here's the situation I recently found myself in:

* Ubuntu Linux 14.10
* Unknown password for user account
* Unknown (but set) root password (Ubuntu's philosophy is to use `sudo` for everything)
* LUKS encrypted filesystem (known passphrase)
* Physical access to the computer

I needed to reset my account password. Normally, with physical access to a machine, all bets are off when it comes to security. I tried booting up the machine into [recovery mode](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode) by holding down <kbd>shift</kbd> as soon as the BIOS had finished loading. But when I selected the "Drop to root shell" option, I was prompted to enter the unknown root password.

My second approach was to boot into single user mode by editing the GRUB command script.

By going down to the recovery mode option and hitting <kbd>e</kbd>, you can edit the GRUB commands. By adding <code>init=/bin/bash</code> at the end of the line beginning with <code>linux</code> that specifies the boot image, you can specify an initial shell to use. Then I hit <kbd>F10</kbd> to boot.

After waiting for about 30 seconds or a minute, I saw a message that waiting for the root device (the locked disk) had timed out. I was then dumped into an [initramfs](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Initramfs) shell. From there, I was able to unlock the disk by running <code>cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 sda3_crypt</code>.

Next, I mounted the freshly-unlocked disk with <code>mount -o rw /dev/sda3 /root</code>, taking advantage of the pre-existing empty directory. From there, I used <code>chroot</code> to run <code>passwd</code> in the OS.

{% highlight bash %}
$ chroot /root passwd
$ chroot /root passwd myUserName
{% endhighlight %}

By running these commands, I successfully reset both the root password as well as the password for my account. From there, I was able to restart the machine and boot normally.
