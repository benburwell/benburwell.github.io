Today, I noticed that Facebook now has a place for you to list your PGP public key. If you go to your "About" page and open the "Contact and Basic Info" section, there is now a line for you to paste your key. In addition to allowing other people to easily access your public key, there's also a checkbox for Facebook to encrypt notification emails with the key.

The mouseover help text states:

> If you check this box, you will receive an encrypted verification email to

I tried it, and just as described, I got an encrypted email signed with PGP key `0xDEE958CF`. After decrypting the email and following the link, I was alerted that email notifications would now be encrypted. I haven't actually verified this, since I don't receive email notifications from Facebook to begin with.

A quick Google search as well as a search in the Facebook Help Center turned up no results, so I'm not sure how recent this is, or perhaps it's being rolled out gradually.
