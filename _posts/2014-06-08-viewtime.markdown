It’s rather astonishing to consider the amount of time for which some viral  videos have been watched. For example, [Ylvis’ “The Fox”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE) has been watched for nearly 3000 years.

ViewTime is a plugin for Safari and Google Chrome that adds the duration the video has been played under its view count.
