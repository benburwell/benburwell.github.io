For my freshman writing seminar at Muhlenberg, I wrote a paper on a system I devised for controlling many different theatrical cueing consoles from one master console using MIDI Show Control (MSC).  I called my system [Unified Show Control [pdf]](/assets/pdf/Unified_Show_Control.pdf).

Shortly after finishing this project, I discovered that [QLab][] from Figure 53 already has MSC built into it. Though it was slightly disappointing, I was thrilled that my idea already exists, albeit in a slightly different form.
