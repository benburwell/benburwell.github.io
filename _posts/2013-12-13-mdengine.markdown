MDEngine was born of my need to serve static Markdown files simply and beautifully. I accomplished this by creating MDEngine, the PHP Markdown Engine.

Itâ€™s extremely lightweight and takes the form of a small collection of files you can drop into any web directory served with Apache which will then serve all `.md` files as beautiful HTML. MDEngine is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bburwell/mdengine).
