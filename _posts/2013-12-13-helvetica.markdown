Those who believe the web should be made more beautiful will appreciate this extension for Safari and Google Chrome that makes all text display in Helvetica Neue (with regular old Helvetica as a backup).

It’s not perfect; there will be some text that is not Helvetica since this is simply the application of a stylesheet. If a site is using significant amounts of JavaScript, some text may not be transformed. This will be corrected in later versions.

For the most part, fonts will be replaced on sites that don’t have very specific typography. In general, you’ll find that sites that have put care into their typeface choices will have those choices preserved.
