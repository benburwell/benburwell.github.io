It’s rather astonishing to consider the amount of time for which some viral  videos have been watched. For example, Ylvis’ “The Fox” has been watched for nearly 3000 years.

ViewTime is a plugin for Safari and Google Chrome that adds the duration the video has been played under its view count.

Installation
------------

_Safari:_ [Download latest version](http://updates.benburwell.com/safari/viewtime/latest.safariextz) and double-click to install.

_Chrome:_ <a href="javascript:chrome.webstore.install();" onclick="chrome.webstore.install();return false;">Click to install</a> or [view on the Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewtime/jcplgieacjacdjabiiedcdfcpbgohbpp).
