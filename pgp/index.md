PGP Keys
========

I digitally sign email with a PGP signature, and prefer to encrypt it when possible. If you would like to send encrypted email to <ben@benburwell.com>, you will need to download and install my [PGP public key](https://keybase.io/benburwell/key.asc).

For more information about using PGP, check out [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy).
