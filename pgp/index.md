PGP Keys
========

I digitally sign email with a PGP signature, and encrypt it when possible. If you would like to send encrypted email to <ben@benburwell.com>, you will need to download and install my [PGP public key](https://keybase.io/benburwell/key.asc).

You can see my [publicly-auditable identity on Keybase](https://keybase.io/benburwell).
