<h1>Espresso Experiments</h1>

<p>A few years ago, I bought a cheap stove top espresso maker. I've been using
it casually on and off since then, but I've come to the conclusion that a more
scientific approach would result in an improved product.</p>

<p>I am definitely not an espresso expert; this is simply my way of trying
to make a better shot. Besides enjoying espresso just on its own, I find that
condensed milk makes an excellent addition, as it seems to allow the espresso to
stand on its own next to the milk rather than diluting the taste as ordinary
milk does.</p>

<p>The measurements below have some seemingly strange units. For bean quantity, I
simply use the timer setting on my grinder. For grind, I again simply list my
grinder setting. It has Extra Fine, Fine, Medium, and Coarse settings, with each
being divided into four sub-settings. I'm calling these Extra Fine 1, Extra Fine
2, Extra Fine 3, Extra Fine 4, Fine 1, etc. For the heat, this is simply what I
set my small stove burner to, in the range Lo, 1, 2, ..., 9, Hi.</p>
